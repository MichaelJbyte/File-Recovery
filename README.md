# File-Recovery
Project reviewing both deleting and recovering files. 9/1/25

Today's exercise will consist of me using applications to definitively remove data from a disk and recover any deleted data. I will also learn about what really happens to deleted data, whether in the trash bin or removed from there. My aim is to obtain expereience with both file deletion and revocery for any future endeavors that may require said skills.

## Deleted Data

Reading an article from the site [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/197436/what-happens-to-data-when-it-gets-deleted-from-your-recycle-bin/), I learned that deleted data is not actually removed from your system.

Any data deleted from the trash can becomes free space in the disk, allowing it to vbe overwritten by data in the future that requires space. The actual information is still there, and still retrievable.

The shortcut, however, to the data is removed. This means you cannot access the data through the same file or name you may have used before.  

## File Removal (Eraser)

Beginning the exercise, I install the free application, Eraser. This is a common tool used for almost complete removal of files and disk partitions. 

1. First, I decide to make two folders containing an image and text file.
   - I plan to recover one and permanantely remove the other. This will achieve both of my objectives, deleting and retrieving lost data.

2. Using Eraser, I setup a task and select the 'Delete This Folder' folder from my files.
   - This task is set to run immediately, quickly disposing of the slected files.
   - Eraser allowed me to chose from a variety of data erasing methods. I selected the Air Force 5020 method, though the Gutmann method would be the stronger option.

3. After running the task, the file was promptly removed from the system without a trace.
   - This simple process would accomplish my first goal.

## File Retrieval (Disk Drill)

I proceed to install the Disk Drill software, intended for system scans and data recovery. Next, I remove the second folder I created using the trash bin.
I plan to fetch the other folder, 'Recover This Folder', demonstrating my use of the tool and its performance.

1. Launching the application, I am greeted with a window displaying the current drive of my entire system. On the right, a 'Search for lost data' button is present. I will use this button to begin the scan of my drive.
   - Scans are the first step in the file recovery process.

2. After the scan is complete, I search for both folders that I have deleted up to this point. (One with Eraser, the other through the Trash Bin.)

- When searching through the scan, I found both folders that I had deleted were present in the lost data section. This showed the scan was very helpful in recovering the deleted data. However, this discovery pointed out that a stronger erasure method with more passes should have been used for the folder I intended to be permanently removed.

3. Once the files are selected, I was able to recover them and put them inside a new folder.
   - Ideally the files should be recovered in a different storage device for them to be accesible. However, I do not have another storage device on hand, and my disks are not partioned. Therefore, they will remain inaccessible in the image below.

# Afterthoughts

Overall this experience gave me great hands-on work with file recovery and removal tools. I understand all the conditions that come along with these tools, such as the varying success with using different erasure methods and the importance of transferring recovered files to another storage device. I am also aware of what happens to data that is deleted through the trash bin, unlike before. My aim for the project was completed and helped me to familiarlize with this concept.
